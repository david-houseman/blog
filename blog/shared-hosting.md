Shared hosting is the cheapest and simplest option for a simple website.
My hosting provider, `ventraip.com.au`, charges $5 AUD per month for its
smallest package. The configuration is handled by `cPanel` and it has
support for this python/flask (WSGI) application. SSL appears to be handled
automatically with signed certificates provided by `cPanel`.
