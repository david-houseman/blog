<p>Shared hosting is the cheapest and simplest option for a simple website. My hosting provider, <code>ventraip.com.au</code>, charges $5 AUD per month for its smallest package. The configuration is handled by <code>cPanel</code> and it has support for this python/flask (WSGI) application. SSL is now handled automatically and for free with signed certificates provided by <code>cPanel</code>. This means <code>http</code> access can be redirected to <code>https</code> access, by adding the following lines to <code>.htaccess</code>:</p>
<pre><code>RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\.)?grey-house\.net
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.grey-house.net/$1 [R,L]</code></pre>
