<p>title: SSH credentials for GitHub author: David Houseman date: 2021-11-25</p>
<p>Beginning August 2021, GitHub has moved to token-based authentication for command line git access. In other words, passwords are no longer accepted.</p>
<p>The SSH public key/s can be uploaded to github in the Settings -&gt; SSH and GPG keys section of the github website. The accompanying documentation for generating a key pair using <code>ssh-keygen</code> is very clear and helpful.</p>
<p>The following data need to be added to ~/.ssh/config so that the ssh client authenticates with github using the correct credentials.</p>
<pre><code>Host github.com
User git
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github</code></pre>
<p>It is helpful to test the connection using</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh -T github.com</code></pre>
<p>and confirming that the correct key is used. After this change <code>.git/config</code> so that the remote url uses <code>ssh</code> instead of <code>https</code>. It should now be possible to <code>git pull</code>.</p>
